&lt;p>I am interested in improving the generalization capabilities of machine learning models by better understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive their performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I received my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from &lt;a href="https://nu.edu.kz/">Nazarbayev University&lt;/a> in 2022.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PhD Student</title><link>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/ankit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 15:52:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/ankit/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am a first-year PhD Student at the &lt;a href="https://tuebingen.ai/">Tübingen AI Center&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/">University of Tübingen&lt;/a>, supervised by &lt;a href="https://coallaoh.github.io/">Seong Joon Oh&lt;/a> and co-supervised by &lt;a href="https://bethgelab.org/">Matthias Bethge&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/6cfe0e6127fa25df2a0ef2ae1067d915-Paper.pdf">simplicity bias&lt;/a> often causes machine learning models to learn semantically meaningless, &amp;ldquo;spurious&amp;rdquo; correlations between inputs and outputs. This phenomenon hurts generalization, thus leading to often unpredictable failure cases and our inability to trust AI systems. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in understanding how to encourage ML models to learn more meaningful, causal correlations instead. Better generalization capability and trustworthiness would follow as direct consequences.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PhD Student</title><link>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/stefano/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2024 19:50:20 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/stefano/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am a PhD student in the International Max-Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (&lt;a href="https://imprs.is.mpg.de/">IMPRS-IS&lt;/a>), supervised by Christian Baumgartner and co-supervised by Seong Joon Oh at the University of Tübingen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I work on few-shot learning and domain generalisation for medical image analysis. I am passionate about developing more “human-like” machine learning methods, which mimic our ability to make predictions based on a limited number of training examples and to generalise to unsee tasks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Arnas Uselis | PhD Student</title><link>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/arnas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jul 2023 11:26:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/arnas/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD student at the University of Tübingen and the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (&lt;a href="https://imprs.is.mpg.de/">IMPRS-IS&lt;/a>), under the supervision of Seong Joon Oh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m primarily interested in enhancing the generalization capabilities of current machine learning systems. This involves learning robust representations from raw data and using them in a way that accurately reflects data generative processes. I believe that mimicking the structure of the real-world in our models, both in how we learn representations and in how we use them, is a key part of making progress towards trustworthy systems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MSc student</title><link>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/evgenii/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jun 2023 13:06:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/evgenii/</guid><description>&lt;p>My personal page is at &lt;a href="https://kortukov.github.io">kortukov.github.io&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am currently pursuing my MSc degree in Machine Learning at the &lt;a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/">University of Tübingen&lt;/a>, supervised by Seong Joon Oh, Elisa Nguyen and Alexander Rubinstein.
My research interests primarily revolve around mitigating the &lt;a href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/">risks associated with increasingly powerful ML systems&lt;/a>.
My current focus involves exploring data-driven explainability methods and their application to language models.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I receieved my Bachelor degree in Computer Science from &lt;a href="https://www.msu.ru/en/">Lomonosov Moscow State University&lt;/a> in 2020. During and after my studies, I worked for about 2.5 years as a software engineer at &lt;a href="https://yandex.com/company">Yandex&lt;/a>.
Prior to joining the STAI group, I had the opportunity to work as a student research assistant in the &lt;a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/decision-making/">Decision Making group&lt;/a> at the University of Tübingen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MSc Student</title><link>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/balint/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jun 2023 11:26:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/balint/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am a Machine Learning MSc student at the &lt;a href="https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/">University of Tübingen&lt;/a>, supervised by Seong Joon Oh, Michael Kirchhof, and Alexander Rubinstein.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am interested in model architectures capable of representing different sources of uncertainty. My goal is to contribute to the theoretical foundations of uncertainty in machine learning while developing scalable practical solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I received my BSc degree in Computer Science from &lt;a href="https://www.elte.hu/en/">ELTE Eötvös Loránd University&lt;/a> in 2021 with the Outstanding Student of the Faculty award.

&lt;p>My goal is making machine learning more trustworthy by delivering pretrained uncertainty estimates along with each prediction. To this end, I&amp;rsquo;m developing &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03784">probabilistic embeddings&lt;/a> that represent a model&amp;rsquo;s uncertainty directly in its embedding space. I love to understand and prove things first from a theoretical perspective first (&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02865">like MCInfoNCE&lt;/a>) and then scale them to large datasets &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03810">as in the new URL benchmark&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Group Leader</title><link>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/joon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2022 15:52:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ScalableTrustworthyAI.github.io/member/joon/</guid><description>&lt;p>My personal page is at &lt;a href="https://coallaoh.github.io/">seongjoonoh.com&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
