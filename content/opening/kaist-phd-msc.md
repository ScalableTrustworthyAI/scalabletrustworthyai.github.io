1. Send an email to [Seong Joon Oh](mailto:coallaoh@gmail.com) with your CV and research statement attached
2. Coffee chat with Seong Joon & lab members to figure out fit
3. Interview: The interview structure is 30 min + 30 min.
   - *First half*: You'll present your prior work. Typically, applicants aim for a 10-minute talk to present one or two relevant past work. This leaves ample time (20 minutes) for discussion.
   - *Second half*: We chat more freely about future research ideas, where we try to find an interesting future topic that lies in the intersection between your expertise and our vision and interests. It would be great to prepare one slide with a few ideas at the intersection of our interest. Available current members join the interview.
4. Apply to the grad school with Seong Joon Oh's supervision intent via [KAIST Graduate Admissions](https://admission.kaist.ac.kr/)
