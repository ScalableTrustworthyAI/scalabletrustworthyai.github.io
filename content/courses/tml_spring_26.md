description = "As machine learning technology gets applied to actual products and solutions, new challenges have emerged. Models unexpectedly fail to generalise well to small changes in the distribution; some models are found to utilise sensitive features that could treat certain demographic user groups unfairly; models tend to be confident on novel types of data; models cannot communicate the rationale behind their decisions effectively with the end users like medical staff to maximise the human-machine synergies. Collectively, we face a trustworthiness issue with the current machine learning technology. A large fraction of the machine learning research nowadays is dedicated to expanding the frontier of Trustworthy Machine Learning (TML). The course covers a theoretical and technical background for key topics in TML. We conduct a critical review of important classical and contemporary research papers on related topics and provide hands-on practicals to implement TML techniques."

## Overview

### Goal

1. Students will be able to critically read, assess, and discuss research work in Trustworthy Machine Learning (TML).
2. Students will gain the technical background to implement basic TML techniques in a deep learning framework.
3. Students will be ready to conduct their own research in TML and make contributions to the research community.

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Python and PyTorch coding.
- A pass grade from the Deep Learning Course (or equivalent).
- Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts.
- Basic maths: multivariate calculus, linear algebra, probability, statistics, and optimisation.

## TML Book

Last year's course materials are now a book. You can find it here: https://trustworthyml.io/. It's also on arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08215.

Special thanks to [Bálint](../../member/balint/) for the majority of the work. Also, kudos to last year's tutors: [Alex](../../member/alex/), [Elisa](../../member/elisa/), and [Michael](../../member/michael/).

Note: The course materials are updated yearly to stay aligned with the latest research. The book will be useful for the course. However, it won't cover new topics added to the course.
