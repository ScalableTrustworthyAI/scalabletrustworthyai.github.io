I am planning to pursue a Master’s degree at KAIST AI, and I studied Electronic Engineering at Sogang University.
My personal homepage is [Homepage](https://jhcor.notion.site/?pvs=74).

My research interests center on advancing the capabilities of large language models beyond perception toward cognition. 
During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research on this topic and published a related paper on orientation understanding as the first author at CVPR 2025.

I also place strong importance on holistic insight and integration. Based on my experience across diverse domains—from hardware-level knowledge grounded in electronic engineering to research in speech signal processing and medical image processing—I strive to adopt integrative thinking that spans multiple levels.
