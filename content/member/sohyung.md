I am a PhD student supervised by Seong Joon Oh at KAIST.

I work on efficient architectures driven by bio-plausible learning. By combining mechanistic interpretability with human-centric benchmarking, I aim to build AI systems that understand and align with human intention and emotion.

Before joining the KAIST, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Biotechnology/Artificial Intelligence from Korea University and my Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence from Seoul National University, advised by MyungJoo Kang, department of mathematical science, focusing on reinforcement learning and Out-of-distrribution learning and contrastive learning. During internship, I've worked as student researcher in IBS, in South Korea.
