I am an incoming MSc student at KAIST AI (Spring 2026) and I studied Computer Science and Chemistry at KAIST. My research interests are Trustworthy Machine Learning, Large Language Models, and AI Agents.

I previously co-founded a deep learning startup and have worked across research, engineering, and product roles in AI startups. My research experience includes speech synthesis and audio understanding, and I have published at ICASSP.

Recently, I have been working on evaluation frameworks for tool-using agents, focusing on how agents decompose tasks, acquire information from multiple sources, and integrate heterogeneous outputs in a reliable way.
