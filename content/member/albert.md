I post a summary of my projects and ideas at [aldakata.github.io](https://aldakata.github.io).

I am a M.Sc. Machine Learning student at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/), working with Elisa Nguyen and Seong Joon Oh on [Annotation By-products](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17595). I am especially interested in the impact of particular training data samples on the training dynamics, with a special focus on improving data efficiency.

Previously, I was a research assistant at [CVUB](http://www.ub.edu/cvub/) under [Petia Radeva](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p_MCjd4AAAAJ&hl=en), where I worked on how to better model label noise on _Learning with Noisy Labels_ [see paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167865524001132).

In my free time I can be found looking for open source projects to contribute to, or somewhere under the sun.
