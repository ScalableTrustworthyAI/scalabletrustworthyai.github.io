Hey there!

My current work involves a master's thesis on Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models, conducted at the Scalable Trustworthy AI Chair (Prof. Seong Joon Oh) in collaboration with Apple (Dr. Michael Kirchhof). Holding a background in classical computer science, I have specialized in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence during my masters. 

While the recent progress in LLM research and tools is significant, solving fundamental challenges such as uncertainty (regarding output reliability) and explainability (understanding system rationale) remain critical in making these systems beneficial in a wide area of application scenarios. My thesis research is dedicated to contributing to the resolution of these issues.
