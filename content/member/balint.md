I am a Machine Learning MSc student at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/), supervised by Seong Joon Oh, Michael Kirchhof, and Alexander Rubinstein.

I am interested in model architectures capable of representing different sources of uncertainty. My goal is to contribute to the theoretical foundations of uncertainty in machine learning while developing scalable practical solutions.

I received my BSc degree in Computer Science from [ELTE Eötvös Loránd University](https://www.elte.hu/en/) in 2021 with the Outstanding Student of the Faculty award. I previously worked on neural program synthesis with a focus on provable correctness.
