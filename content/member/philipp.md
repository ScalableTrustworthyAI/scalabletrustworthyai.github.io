I am a MSc student at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/), supervised by Seong Joon Oh, Elisa Nguyen, and Ameya Prabhu (Bethgelab Tübingen). My thesis aims to quantify the influence of training data samples on LLM-generated text. I am especially interested in how attribution results differ between base models and instruction-tuned models.

I earned my Bachelor’s degree with distinction in [Mathematical Data Science at the Georg-August University in Göttingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/640713.html), where I wrote my thesis in cooperation with AUDI AG. There, I explored Active Learning to reduce labeling costs in Surface Defect Detection for Automobiles.

Before starting my Master's thesis, I was a research assistant at the [German Aerospace Center (DLR)](https://www.dlr.de/en) for two years, focusing on Computer Vision systems for UAVs.
