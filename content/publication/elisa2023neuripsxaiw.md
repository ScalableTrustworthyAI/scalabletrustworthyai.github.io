abstract = "Explainable AI (XAI) aims to provide insight into opaque model reasoning to humans and as such is an interdisciplinary field by nature. In this paper, we interviewed 10 practitioners to understand the possible usability of training data attribution (TDA) explanations and to explore the design space of such an approach. We confirmed that training data quality is often the most important factor for high model performance in practice and model developers mainly rely on their own experience to curate data. End-users expect explanations to enhance their interaction with the model and do not necessarily prioritise but are open to training data as a means of explanation. Within our participants, we found that TDA explanations are not well-known and therefore not used. We urge the community to focus on the utility of TDA techniques from the human-machine collaboration perspective and broaden the TDA evaluation to reflect common use cases in practice."
