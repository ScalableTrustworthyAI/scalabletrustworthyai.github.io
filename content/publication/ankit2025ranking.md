abstract = "We study whether visual embedding models capture continuous, ordinal attributes along linear directions, which we term _rank axes_. We define a model as _rankable_ for an attribute if projecting embeddings onto such an axis preserves the attribute's order. Across 7 popular encoders and 9 datasets with attributes like age, crowd count, head pose, aesthetics, and recency, we find that many embeddings are inherently rankable. Surprisingly, a small number of samples, or even just two extreme examples, often suffice to recover meaningful rank axes, without full-scale supervision. These findings open up new use cases for image ranking in vector databases and motivate further study into the structure and learning of rankable embeddings."
